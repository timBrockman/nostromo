# HTML-Specific Guidelines for Nostromo
Use pure semantic HTML for classless stylingâ€”Nostromo applies defaults to elements without classes.
- Structure: <body> as terminal canvas; <pre> for ASCII art; include <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/nostromo.min.css">.
- Usage: Demonstrate retro interfaces with monospace text; test ASCII art in <pre> blocks for alignment.
- Conventions: No inline styles or classes; ensure viewport meta for responsive terminals.
- Agentic Flow: Generate examples with semantic markup and ASCII samples; validate CRT emulation.
- Emphasis: Fixed-width typefaces ensure ASCII art renders accurately, emulating Nostromo's computer displays.
Keep minimal: Focus on text-heavy, terminal-like content.
